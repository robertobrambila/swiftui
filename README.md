# SwiftUI
A repository for sharing custom SwiftUI components, styles and examples. These are generic versions of production assets that I'm using across my own projects, I hope you find them useful :)

### LinearGradientToggle
<img alt="Linear Gradient Toggle" src="media/LinearGradientToggle.gif">
*(Components/LinearGradientFillToggle.swift + Styles/LinearGradientFillToggleStyles.swift)*

Toggle component with custom label & active/inactive gradients.

---

### LitDivider
*(Components/LitDivider.swift)*

Like a DIV but stacked with a highlight/shadow.

---

### SwapButtons
*(Components/SymbolSwapButton.swift* & *Components/LabelSwapButton.swift)*

Button components that allow you to swap between two states (either two SwiftUI Symbols or two String labels). Also include the ability to revert back to their initial state based on a timed delay.
